## NOTE: After getting feedback, we realized that FTP is a better platform to use for sync. Please [click here](https://code.google.com/p/iqbox-ftp/) for our FTP-based version, that supports multiple OSes. We will continue maintaining this version of IQBox-SVN. ##

## IQBox is a Windows program (SVN client) that lets you keep files in sync automatically using any SVN (Subversion) server. (SVN servers are free too!) ##

## Get Started ##
  * Download now from the [Downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/iqbox-svn/downloads/list)
  * Just unzip and run the IQBox.EXE or check out the [help and FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/iqbox-svn/wiki/FAQandHelp)
  * (Optional) Install [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net) to get green "sync'd" icons in Windows Explorer once files are sync'd.
  * If you need a free, simple SVN server to host your IQBox, I suggest [VisualSVN Server Standard edition](http://www.visualsvn.com/server/download/).

## Main features ##
  * Silently syncs across any number of computers. (SVN knowledge recommended for now.)
  * Only uploads parts of a large file that change, making it **super-quick**!
  * Real-time file access detection.
  * Uses any standard SVN server! Supports SSL.

### Other Features ###
  * Only syncs when CPU is below 75% to minimize system impact (unless this keeps going on, it which case it eventually syncs after a few hours.)
  * Runs sync operations in a "Below Normal" priority thread to ensure there's no interruptions.
  * Unobtrusive system tray icon.
  * Easy setup wizard.
