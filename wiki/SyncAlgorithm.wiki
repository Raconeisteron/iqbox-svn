#summary Architecture of how the sync is actually done, in progress
#labels Phase-Design

= Stand-alone Sync =

  * *svn st* is called and the results are stored into a string.
_Improvement: Do not list all at once. Terminate the "svn st" thread once 20-100 files that need work are loaded, since we don't need to load the whole list at once._

  * The string is split into an array, and the original string removed from memory to save RAM.

  * For each entry in the array:
    * Get the flag f = A, !, M, D
    * Get the filename r
    * Process File(r, f)

PROCESS FILE FUNCTION (file, flag):
  * Case "?" 
    * Item not under Ver Control: Add and commit file.
  * Case "A"
    *'Scheduled for addition, but not uploaded, so upload now: commit file.
  * Case "M"
    * Modified. commit file.
  * Case "C"
    * Item is in conflict with updates received from repository. Currently, no automated handling for this. _Recommended: Copy the file to file_conflict_datestamp.ext and add+commit that file, and/or notify the user, and/or rename the old file and keep this as the current new one._
            Case "I" 'Item is being ignored by SVN
            Case "!" 'Item is missing
                Log("Deleting...", False)
                SvnDelete(r)
                Log(" Done.", True)
            Case "~" 'Item is versioned as a directory, but has been replaced by a file, or vice versa. The second column tells the status of a file's or directory's properties.
            Case "L" 'Item is locked
            Case Else
