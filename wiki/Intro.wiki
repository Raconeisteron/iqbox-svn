= Introduction =

The goal of IQBox is to create a client application for Windows that can easily and without pain sync multiple computers. Whether its laptop and desktop, work PCs, sharing with coworkers.
Another secondary goal is to have a very easy SVN client that "just syncs" automatically most of the time. At this time that is only a secondary goal.
